# ВЕБ-ПРО100Р
http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/60179/Web-Browser-in-C - initially the project was forked from there.
It is an application based on class WebBrowser from .Net framework, with extended capabilities. Of course,
it doubles the well-known Internet Explorer, and can be used only in presence of its 'Parent' on your system.
But it's main intention is to become a new-generation browser for development works. Not only reading internet
documents but also being used to develop them. Alongside with a server-side part.
